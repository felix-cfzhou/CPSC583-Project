  abstract = { A k-tree is a graph that can be reduced to the k-complete graph by a sequence of removals of a degree k vertex with completely connected neighbors. We address the problem of determining whether a graph is a partial graph of a k-tree. This problem is motivated by the existence of polynomial time algorithms for many combinatorial problems on graphs when the graph is constrained to be a partial k-tree for fixed k. These algorithms have practical applications in areas such as reliability, concurrent broadcasting and evaluation of queries in a relational database system. We determine the complexity status of two problems related to finding the smallest number k such that a given graph is a partial k-tree. First, the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete. Second, for a fixed (predetermined) value of k, we present an algorithm with polynomially bounded (but exponential in k) worst case time complexity. Previously, this problem had only been solved for \$k = 1,2,3\$. }
